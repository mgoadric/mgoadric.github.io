title:  "QA76"

In college, I browsed the bookstore and library quite a bit as a hobby. On one trip
in particular during my senior year, I remember finding 
[_Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach_](http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597/)
by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. Besides kicking off my interest in AI which would
eventually turn into my Ph.D. thesis, I for some
reason memorized the first portion of the 
[Library of Congress Classification](http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/),
[QA76](http://www.slc.bc.ca/mac/qa76.htm). This alphanumeric code became a 
signpost for me: Q for Science, A for Mathematics,
and 76 for Computer Science. When I would spot it on a book,
almost always I would find something of interest within.

This blog is an exploration of my interests in computer science, education, 
complexity, and game design, mostly sticking to topics
in the QA76 category, thus the name of the blog. I hope to talk about my current work, 
both research projects and classroom pedagogy, but also reflect on current computing 
issues and links that fascinate me.
