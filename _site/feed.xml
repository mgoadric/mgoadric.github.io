&lt;p&gt;In the past, I assigned a set of problems, and then in class I would ask students which 
problems they wanted to present, giving those students with the least number of 
completed presentations priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many days, I was dissatisfied mostly with the level of interaction in class between the 
students during a presentation. I felt like the presentations were mainly just for me as 
the instructor, because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They were all working on the same problems, and therefore weren’t really teaching 
each other new material.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They discussed the questions and studied together before class.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They didn’t want to ask questions and potentially hurt another student’s grade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester I am exploring a new method of grading which I hope is encouraging 
collaboration and class discussions. The details can be found on the course homepage 
linked above, and there are some kinks that I plan on fixing in future iterations of 
the course, 
but I think this system has been mostly successful. The main points are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students are randomly assigned to groups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Problems are selected to be on the difficult end of the spectrum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each group is assigned distinct yet equivalent problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A student is randomly selected from the group and is then solely responsible 
for presenting the group’s solution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students must be in class to recieve points when they are awarded, even if they are not presenting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra points are awarded to students for asking constructive questions of other groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equivalent-yet-distinct problems are creating much more discussion in class since they
have not all necessarily worked through the complexities of problems not assigned to them.
There is also some peer pressure to encourage good presentations, since the whole groups’
grade hinges on the presentation of a randomly-selected member. Most students are 
taking advantage of the points for asking questions to other groups. It is common 
that the class finds minor typos or mistakes in a proof or automata construction, and
everyone’s presentation skills are improving over the course of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting piece that has added some fun tension to presentation days is the way I
select the group member to present. I use an algorithm (described here in an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/mark.goadrich.com/courses/csci380f15/Weighted%20Class%20Presentations.ipynb&quot;&gt;IPython notebook&lt;/a&gt;) that tends to pick members who
have not presented recently, but could very well pick the same group member twice or three
times in a row. Many times I can hear some mumbled prayers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rngesus&quot;&gt;RNGesus&lt;/a&gt;,
although they often fall on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll write a wrapup post after I read the course evaluations from my students, they might
have a completely different perspective, and I’ll talk about the pieces that have been
less than successful.&lt;/p&gt;

The delay of presentations, revise to have a 1 week window

Extra points rely on incorrect presentations.

When a presentation is unsuccessful, reasign using random alg again

students absent when selected, affects whole group, to prevent them being forced out.

One or two in each group are writing up solutions.

Each invitee is asked
to speak on the simple question “What is my calling/vocation and how do I know?”
and is free to interpret this question however they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are links to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/hendrixcollege/tuesdaytalks_goadrich&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt;

of my talk. I was thankful to be invited, I found it a wonderful opportunity to reflect on what led me here, although
I was struck by the process of creating the narrative for my life. My talk is really only 
based on a true story. Each decision, turning point, or motivation I mention (for instance, 
my decision to take a job in San Antonio and subsequently leave that job after 5 months) 
was much more complicated than
I related, and I needed to simplify many parts to get to something with a
beginning, middle and end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, 
besides &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Making-Science-James-Gleick/dp/0143113453&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chaos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

there were more influential books along my path here that I left out for the
sake of brevity, including 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gödel Escher Bach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,

and the previously mentioned 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
Perhaps I will dive into their
influence in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I do abstraction all the time as an educator.
I usually work through a messy, complicated topic in computer science, 
looking for a good way to structure a 
lesson or lab, and inevitably details are left out and modified to fit some
overarching tale. But I had not critically abstracted on my own life story in quite
some time,
and it highlighted for me just how messy and complicated everyone’s life story must be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Last month, I was invited to give a Tuesday Talk here at Hendrix, a series of talks about vocation and calling, going on now for about a decade.

&lt;p&gt;In college, I browsed the bookstore and library quite a bit as a hobby. On one trip
in particular during my senior year, I remember finding 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. Besides kicking off my interest in AI which would
eventually turn into my Ph.D. thesis, I for some
reason memorized the first portion of the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/&quot;&gt;Library of Congress Classification&lt;/a&gt;,
QA76. This alphanumeric code became a signpost for me: Q for Science, A for Mathematics,
and 76 for Computer Science. When I would spot it on a book,
almost always I would find something of interest within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog will be an exploration of my interests in computer science, education, 
complexity, and game design, mostly sticking to topics
in the QA76 category, thus the name of the blog. I hope to talk about my current work, 
both research projects and classroom pedagogy, but also reflect on current computing 
issues and links that fascinate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad to have you along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I have found my home in QA76.</summary></entry></feed>
