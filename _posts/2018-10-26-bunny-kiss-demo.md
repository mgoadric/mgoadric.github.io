I've reached a milestone in my development of Bunny Kiss, finally laying out sensible
levels for a tutorial, and it is ready for early playtesting!

Here is a link to the [prototype](http://mgoadric.github.io/BunnyKiss), if you get a 
chance to play, I'd love to hear your feedback on the graphics, layout, 
sound, difficulty, etc. 

Beyond the addition of Anima2D for making the bunny animations, I also learned how to use
[LMMS](https://lmms.io/) for creating background music. Starting with a student's
[LMMS Tutorial](http://mark.goadrich.com/courses/csci370s17/LMMS/), I quickly figured out
how to make notes MIDI-style and a drum beat. I was confused for a while about how to 
add new sounds, but then found the presets tab with all of the classic voices from 
a synthesizer keyboard, and I was ready to compose my background music in just a few hours.
