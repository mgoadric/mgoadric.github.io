Part of my sabbatical project is learning new game development skills, and one I'm 
really excited about is programming in [virtual reality](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/book-unity-gsg/)
in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). 

After a bit of searching, I settled on getting an [Oculus Rift Touch](https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Touch-Virtual-Reality-System-pc/dp/B073X8N1YW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1539708797&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=oculus+rift+touch&psc=1).
It comes with a headset with headphones, two sensors, and two hand-held controls. Setting it
all up requires a fair number of USB and HDMI ports.

More research uncovered that the Oculus, and any current VR headset, would only work on a
Windows PC, and the graphics card and processing requirements were quite high. 
With only my four-year-old MacBook Pro at hand, it 
was time for an upgrade to an [Oculus Ready](https://www.oculus.com/rift/oculus-ready-pcs/) machine. 
I settled on an [Acer Aspire GX](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1339326-REG/acer_dg_b83aa_008_ci7_7700_16gb_1tb_gtx.html)
with the following components:

* 3.6 GHz Intel Core i7-7700 Quad-Core
* 16GB DDR4 RAM
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 (8GB GDDR5)
* 1TB HDD

This was affordable, but not at the bare minimum of requirements, and has proven to be a great
machine for the Oculus. It has also worked well as an intense research computer for 
crunching through parallel card-game simulations, but more about that in another post.

With my smaller sabbatical office space, I'm trying to get the most coverage with the
sensors. I've cleared out a table and bookshelf, and put the sensors on the desk and wall,
aiming for as much overlap coverage as I can get. I also tried extending the range of one 
sensor, picking up a [10ft USB 3.0 cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Extension-Cable-Male-Female/dp/B00NH12O5I/), but with no extra power,
it did not work as advertised. I haven't yet attempted the [3rd sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Sensor-16ft-Repeater-Cable-pc/dp/B0727WDPX6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1539708832&sr=8-3&keywords=oculus+sensor)
setup for [roomscale](https://www.oculus.com/blog/roomscale-revisited-getting-the-most-out-of-your-rift/)
games, but hope to by the end of the year.

So far I have played and enjoyed

* [Oculus First Contact](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1217155751659625/)
* [Mission: ISS](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1178419975552187/)
* [Air Car](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1204731822978255/)
* [Lucky's Tale](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/909129545868758/)
* [Luna](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1184973554901426/)

Going to the International Space Station is quite the experience, and you 
really get a zero-gravity feel by moving with your hands, although orienting by
joystick pulls you out of the immersion sensation. Lucky's Tale, a 3D platformer,
is fun to watch, and while the puzzles in Luna range from exceedingly easy to very obtuse,
it is gorgeous.

Up next on my list to play are

* [Beat Saber](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1304877726278670/)
* [Manifest 99](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1305408259557493/)
* [Superhot VR](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1012593518800648/)

Do you have any suggestions? Want to try out my setup? 
If you're in town, I'd be happy to show you how it works, please sign up for an 
[appointment](https://markgoadrich.youcanbook.me/service/jsps/cal.jsp?cal=RBZYDPYHh7LMhu9PhVvg&ini=1539021289122).
to demo some games!

My first game attempts are going to a 3D version of [Axiom](http://www.axiomgame.com), converting
my old [Java implementation](https://github.com/mgoadric/axiom) to C#, and a
gardening/planting/growth game. Look for more updates when I start development.
