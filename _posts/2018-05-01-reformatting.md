It's been a few years, and with my recent site css refresh, it was time to restart
the blog. I've made the jump to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on 
[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), which looked
extremely confusing the last time I researched it, but now makes complete sense. This 
is still a work in progress, so expect some more style updates and rearrangement.

This coming year, I will be on sabbatical, my first after 11 years of teaching.
Hooray! I'll be updating much more regularly as I work through my game development
and game design projects. But first, some tools I developed for a new course on 
[Computational Humanities](http://mark.goadrich.com/courses/csci270s18/) 
have pushed me to publish a few insights into the 
[Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) series by 
Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, hope to have some
new entries up soon.
