I spent much of November coding up new card games in 
[RECYCLE](https://cardstock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recycle/index.html)
for my 
[CardStock](http://github.com/mgoadric/cardstock)
research project. I finally felt like I had enough diverse games to start
analyzing and writing about what I'm learning by simulating them with 
AI players, and have started a new blog called 
[The Shape of Card Games](http://mgoadric.github.io/cardstock/).

I currently have a few posts up about two games, [Agram](http://mgoadric.github.io/cardstock/trick-taking/2018/11/26/agram.html)
and [Pairs](http://mgoadric.github.io/cardstock/press-your-luck/2019/01/04/pairs.html), looking at the statistics and [heuristics](http://mgoadric.github.io/cardstock/general/2018/12/11/heuristics.html)
of each one, and will be posting many more in the coming weeks and months. It has already generated
some interest over at [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/8730/shape-card-games) where I 
syndicate my posts, and just writing about the games and generating the figures and graphs
is extremely helpful as I prepare to write up a paper on the topic for the 
upcoming [Conference on Games](http://ieee-cog.org/), here's hoping I can get it all
together before the March 24th paper deadline!
