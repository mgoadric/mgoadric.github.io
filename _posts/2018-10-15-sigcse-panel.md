Hooray, my [panel proposal]({% post_url 2018-08-29-civic-hacking %}) for 
[SIGCSE 2019](https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/) was accepted! I'll be moderating
a discussion about "Civic Engagement Across the Computing Curriculum" with 
[Michael Goldweber](http://www.cs.xu.edu/~mikeyg/), 
[Matthew Jadud](http://www.bates.edu/faculty-expertise/profile/matthew-c-jadud/), 
[S. Monisha Pulimood](https://pulimood.pages.tcnj.edu/), and 
[Samuel Rebelsky](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/). 
We hope many attendees will join us to share their 
own experiences with civic engagement, and have built our panel structure
to have an open format for encouraging as much sharing and community building
as we can at the conference. Here's the abstract and overview of our panel, I'll 
post the full paper when we finalize it for submission in the coming months.

## Abstract

As outlined in the [ACM Computer Science Curricula 2013 Guidelines](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf) 
section on Social Issues and Professional Practice, "Students must also be exposed to 
the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of 
the relevant social [and] ethical ... issues." 

In this panel, we demonstrate diverse approaches used to achieve this goal with respect 
to civic engagement. Drawing from experiences with non-major, introductory computing, 
mobile applications, software engineering, and interdisciplinary courses, we discuss 
how to move beyond surface-level discussions of ethical case studies toward an 
integration of civic engagement activities and personal reflection into standard 
computing curriculum. 

## Summary

Many standard computing courses can be enhanced with 
opportunities for civic engagement. Our experiences show that with careful planning and 
support, incorporating civic engagement can increase student motivation and success, and 
open new pathways for underrepresented groups in computing. Our intended panel audience is 
computing educators seeking advice and direction on how to begin implementing civic 
engagement in their courses. We are also targeting educators looking to share their 
own civic engagement experiences and build community. 

## Panel Structure

After a very brief introduction from each panelist (5 minutes total), the moderator 
will ask the panel to comment on the following questions, with the goal of drawing out 
common themes and connections among the panelists on their experiences with civic 
engagement and computing curriculum. 

* How do you involve civic engagement in your courses?
* How do you assess student success?
* What external resources helped or barriers hindered you?
* What lessons have you learned?

We recognize that our positions cannot cover the full spectrum of civic engagement 
experiences. Thus, each of these questions will also be posed to the audience to 
enlarge the conversation. Discussion on each question will be limited to 10 minutes, 
leaving 30 minutes for audience questions and participation.
