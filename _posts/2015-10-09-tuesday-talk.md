Last month, I was invited to give a [Tuesday Talk](https://www.hendrix.edu/tuesdaytalks/) here at [Hendrix](http://hendrix.edu), a series of talks about vocation and calling, going on now for about a decade. Each invitee is asked
to speak on the simple question "What is my calling/vocation and how do I know?"
and is free to interpret this question however they like.

Here are links to the [audio](https://soundcloud.com/hendrixcollege/tuesdaytalks_goadrich)
and 
[text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLsjQR2WYCEezxD9mFOziGMOw4Y20u_1fH5FHh-uSO4/edit?usp=sharing)
of my talk. I was thankful to be invited, I found it a wonderful opportunity to reflect on what led me here, although
I was struck by the process of creating the narrative for my life. My talk is really only 
based on a true story. Each decision, turning point, or motivation I mention (for instance, 
my decision to take a job in San Antonio and subsequently leave that job after 5 months) 
was much more complicated than
I related, and I needed to simplify many parts to get to something with a
beginning, middle and end. 

Also, 
besides [_Chaos_](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Making-Science-James-Gleick/dp/0143113453)
and 
[_Turtles, Termites and Traffic Jams_](http://www.amazon.com/Turtles-Termites-Traffic-Jams-Explorations/dp/0262680939),
there were more influential books along my path here that I left out for the
sake of brevity, including 
[_Gödel Escher Bach_](http://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/),
[_How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics_](http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Modern-Heuristics/dp/3540224947),
[_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_](http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469/),
and the previously mentioned 
[_Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_](http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597/). 
Perhaps I will dive into their
influence in a later post.

Of course, I do abstraction all the time as an educator.
I usually work through a messy, complicated topic in computer science, 
looking for a good way to structure a 
lesson or lab, and inevitably details are left out and modified to fit some
overarching tale. But I had not critically abstracted on my own life story in quite
some time,
and it highlighted for me just how messy and complicated everyone's life story must be.
