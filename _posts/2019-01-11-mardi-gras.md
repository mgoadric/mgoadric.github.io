I was finally able to get in another visit in December to the 
[Little Rock Game Designers](https://www.facebook.com/lrgamedesigners/) to test out my 
[Mardi Gras board game]({% post_url 2018-07-15-design-board %}), as you can see below.

This playtest went quite well even though we only got through two rounds. And based on the feedback,
the rules are now down to three pages plus a component list. Considering they started out 
as twelve pages back in June before the first playtest, this is quite a consolidation and 
simplification.

I'm going to try something new to me with my current board/card game designs, by opening the rules up for
comments, discussion, and revision in the middle of playtesting. I think this fits
more with the public open-source development ethos I've been using for my 
[Ludum]({% post_url 2018-08-14-ld42-baggage-claim %}) [Dare]({% post_url 2019-01-09-ld43-hearts %})
and
[Bunny Kiss]({% post_url 2018-10-26-bunny-kiss-demo %}) projects. So, here are the 
current rules.

* [Schism](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U3Rt6lYhbAfDLlXIGEmMcsfY4VQY1Ne3cL00JEVTnSI/edit?usp=sharing): card game for 3-5, 30 min  
* [Mardi Gras](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbmvM0nk5OOJZWg2AlNIkbu3MxYpjCo8phAHiDtk2Nw/edit?usp=sharing): board game for 3-4, 60 min

Let me know if you have any comments or questions, I appreciate all feedback, thanks!
