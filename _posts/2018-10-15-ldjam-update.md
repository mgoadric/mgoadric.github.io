It's been over a month since my last update. I've had my head down on some projects, but
wanted to take some time today to make some posts on my progress. Here's the first of 
a few.

Voting is complete, and my entry [Baggage Claim](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/baggage-claim) in 
[Ludum Dare 42](http://ldjam.com) placed 12th in the Innovation category and 29th 
for Theme Integration! These are the highest scores I've earned yet in a Ludum Dare!

I've made a [few updates](https://github.com/mgoadric/RunningOutOfSpace) since the 
contest to the graphics, with a crisper background and clearer mechanism on the 
luggage entry, and updated the gameplay a bit, with more controlled randomness on the
selection of the luggage to enter.

Here is an [Android version](http://games.goadrich.com/BaggageClaim2.apk) of the game;
if you download it and get it working, let me know what you think. I still need to create
an in-game tutorial, and change the way scoring works, before I will feel completely
finished with this version.
